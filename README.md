# AIR MOUSE

## BCA Sem VI Major Project

This python project utilizes opencv to detect finger gestures to control the onscreen mouse using color detection technique.

The user is required to attach colored chart papers to their fingers, and select the color in the GUI of the application to track it. They have to choose colored chart papers that do not match with any other color in the background of your webcam.

If you join your thumb and index fingers, then the program will only track your fingers as a single object. This will result in the movement of the mouse cursor.

If you separate your thumb and index fingers, then two objects should be tracked, and register a 'left mouse down' action while also moving the mouse cursor.

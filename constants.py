helpText = 'Air Mouse uses color detection technique to track your fingers. Please choose colored chart papers that do not match with any other color in the background of your webcam. Attach the colored papers to your thumb and index fingers.\nIf you join your thumb and index fingers, then the program will only track your fingers as a single object. This will result in the movement of the mouse cursor.\n If you separate your thumb and index fingers, then two objects should be tracked, and register a \'left mouse down\' action while also moving the mouse cursor.'
